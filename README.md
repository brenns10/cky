## Rationale

After learning a lot about grammars and normal forms in my EECS 343 (Theoretical
Computer Science) class, I decided it would be a fun adventure to implement the
CKY parsing algorithm in C.  And, since nobody likes to specify their grammars
in CNF, I would also have to implement the algorithm to convert a grammar into
CNF.

## Theory

The CKY parsing algorithm is a `O(n^3)` algorithm that parses strings to answer
whether they can be generated by a context-free grammar, given in Chomsky Normal
Form.  Chomsky Normal Form is a form of a grammar with the following
restrictions: rules may be in the form `A --> b`, where `b` is a terminal, or `A
--> B C`, where `B` and `C` are nonterminals.  Any context-free grammar can be
represented in CNF.

There exist other parsing algorithms that run asymptotically faster.  However,
they cannot parse an arbitrary grammar.  Additionally, I'm mainly looking to
implement an algorithm I learned, not reinvent the wheel.

## Goals

I would like to get this project to the point where it can take as inputs a file
with a grammar specification, and lexical specifications for the terminals, and
a file to parse, and then parse the file and output accept or reject, along with
a parse tree if it accepts.  Perhaps it could even output the CKY table!
